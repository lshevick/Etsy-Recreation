    "description": "Pastel blooms Botanical embroidery pattern\n\nNew in our Botanical Collection of embroidery panels is this wonderful pale floral design featuring ranunculus style and springlike flowers in soft and muted colours. The Pastel Blooms panel shows again Annie&#39;s colour sensitivity with a calming and restricted colour palette.\n\nWe are really pleased to offer you our collection of gorgeous hand painted illustrations which are digitally pre-printed onto luxurious cotton/linen panels with eco friendly inks. These panels are more than standard embroidery patterns with the artwork pre-printed, so no need for transferring designs. They are suitable for beginners along with more experienced embroiderers, for use with hand embroidery, freemotion embroidery, applique or even needle felting embellishment. Simply stitch as much or as little as you desire! Ideal starting points for those crafters who are unsure of their own illustrations but want a helping hand and something more modern. We have designed them to fit a 6 inch hoop or 6 inch aperture mount, with the actual Linen being approximately 25cm square. Now available in addition to our collection of gift boxed sets so that crafters and sewing enthusiasts who already possess the necessary equipment also have access to our designs. Please be advised that these printed designs do not come with any instructions. If you would prefer to have instructions and stitch guides, then our boxed kits include everything you need to while away some blissful relaxing hours creating some modern embroidery hoop art, from the linen, threads, needles and felt for the backing! These pre-printed embroidery panels could be developed into cushions, bags or simply framed as your very own piece of art.

    "description": "Christmas - Holiday - Rudolph - Nail Wrap - Nail Strip -  Dry Nail Polish\n\nHow to use:\n\nStep 1: Clean and dry your nails\n\nStep 2: Select the right fit\n\nStep 3: Remove the clear protective cover and peel the wrap from the backing\n\nStep 4: Line the wrap up right to the edge of your cuticle and rub firmly to adhere. Be careful not to place it on your skin, as it will affect the length of wear.\n\nStep 5: File off the excess in a downward motion\n\nOptional (but recommended) Step 6: apply a top coat for extra durability. Do not use ‚Äúquick dry‚Äù top coats as they will cause the wrap to wrinkle/shrink.\n\nOther tips:\nAvoid lotion, submerging hands in water or other wet or messy activities for a couple of hours to allow the wraps to set. I find it best to put them on before bed, and then wake up and put a top coat on.\n\nIf you‚Äôre seeing bubbles or wrinkles on the second day, you may not have pressed or rubbed firmly enough when applying.\n\nIt‚Äôs better to size down than up - using a wrap too big for your nails will prevent a good seal from forming if the wrap is touching your skin.",

    "description": "Nail wrap or decals.  Nail wraps are changing the manicure process.  A cheaper process that allows you to apply at home.\n- Simply peel the nail polish strips and apply to a clean nail bed.\n- File away the excess for an instant manicure.\n- Intended to fit adult nails, however they can be stretched and trimmed.\n- Non-toxic, made of 100% nail polish.  They do have an adhesive backing to help adhere to the nail bed.\nThis listing includes 1 nail wrap, as pictured, each order will include a cuticle stick, alcohol swab, instruction card, and nail file.  If additional instruction card is needed, please message me to include with order.\n\nTips for best application:\n- Lightly buff the nail bed with the nail file to reduce ridges in the nail bed.  This helps with adherence of the nail wrap as well.\n- Use a ph bond or Orly bonder prior to adhering to the nail bed, this will dry out the nail bed removing any oils that may be on the nail bed.\n- Use the alcohol swab included to clean nail beds and fingertips to ensure clean nail bed area.\n- After applying refrain from soaking hands in water for 8 hours.\n- It is best to apply prior to bed to allow time for nail wraps to set.\n- If you have shorter nails, one wrap will can give you 2 manicures.  If you use one side for one manicure by cutting the excess off each nail and then applying that excess to the other hand.",

    "description": "These nail wraps are the perfect touch to your winter ensemble. The pattern features a mix of Santas, glittery gifts and snowflakes. Such a fun combination! The application is easy and apply flawlessly to your nails! \n\nPro tip: file your nails thoroughly to provide good grip for the wraps or apply a rubberized base coat polish to maximize adhesion. The wraps can last up to 10 days with proper preparation! \n\nAs a bonus, for shorter nails, each wrap can be cut in half so there is no waste of the pretty design! \n\nEach wrap is made of thin, 100% nail polish and can be mixed and matched to any other colors or patterns you‚Äôd like! I‚Äôve used these for years and can attest these are the best on the market. I love the ease of application and how perfect they look when applied. (Not to mention fast!) Get ready to be asked where you get your nails done! \n\nSome pro tips for application:\n- make sure your nails are clean and dry; no oils or lotions should be present. Use a quick swipe of alcohol or nail polish remover to remove any build up\n- I‚Äôve had better luck slightly buffing the top of my nail with a fine grade nail board. This isn‚Äôt necessary, but it gives the wrap a bit more grip to hold on to. \n- most wraps will probably have to be trimmed to fit your nail perfectly. The key is getting it slightly smaller than your actual nail size with no skin or cuticle overlap. I trim the overhang with scissors then file the rest off.\n- make sure to seal the top with a clear polish if you want them to last a long time. \n\nA list of instructions and a nail file will be included with each order. \n\nYou got this! Enjoy!",

Winifred later became a nun and Abbess at Gwytherin in Wales.\n\n¬©Tracy L. Christianson, all rights reserved.",

    "description": "Handmade by Wandering Cosmic Hearts. Design is printed using a direct to garment printer. Backside is blank. GROW YOUR OWN WAY Baby Bib. \n\nPrinted on a cotton blend knit terry. 75% cotton, 25% polyester. Recommended for ages 3-9 months. Machine washable and dryer safe. \n\nThis design is DTG printed, this is NOT sublimation, iron on or vinyl, it is high quality direct to garment printed which means you can wash and dry as often as needed and you never have to worry about the image design fading. Beautiful, vibrant print. \n\nCOFFEE DYED COLORS -. All the coffee colors are hand-dyed by me right here at the studio. Available colors are WINTER WHITE, LIGHT COFFEE, MEDIUM COFFEE and DARK ROAST. The light coffee color is the off-white natural looking color that you see in a lot of the product photos. The coffee colors are lightly hand washed in a free and clear laundry soap and rinsed thoroughly. The end result leaves a beautiful flawless color. \n\nREFUNDS and CANCELLATIONS: Bib printing is made to order, once the bib has been colored and/or printed, I will not be able to cancel or refund. If you made a mistake with sizing or something else, please message me as soon as you can or immediately after to make a change or to cancel. Because these bibs are made to order, I am unable to offer refunds or exchanges. Each bib is quality inspected during packaging. \n\nSHIPPING: Shipping time frame is 2-3 days after order is placed, sometimes sooner. Most bib orders are shipped USPS First Class. If your order is over $35, then you qualify for free first-class shipping. USPS Priority is used for multiple items with a combined weight over 15 ounces. If you need your order rushed or need it for a baby shower or other event, please kindly message me and I will do my very best to get your order shipped out ASAP. \n\nCUSTOM or PERSONALIZATION: I do offer custom and personalized bibs. I can do rock bands, birth or baby announcement shirts, special images or clipart, characters and more. Whatever design you would like, just reach out to me and I will do my best to put something fabulous together for you. You will receive mockup images until you are happy with your design that you choose. \n\nPlease be sure to include a gift message if the item is being sent to a loved one, family or friend. If the gift message box is left blank, then the gift recipient will not know who it is from. Please also make sure you have the correct shipping address when checking out.\n\nThank you so much for checking out my shop and I look forward to creating a shirt for your little one to wear proudly.\n\nMany Blessings,\n- Danielle @ WCH",
